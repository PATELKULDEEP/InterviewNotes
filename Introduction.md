# **Introduction**
Hello, I'm Kuldeep Patel. I have completed my B. Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication from Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg. I started my career at Accenture, Where I was trained as a Java full stack Developer. 

For the past three year, I've been working on a life sciences client project. During this time, I've gained hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, Rest APIs, SQL, and React. My work includes application enhancements, fixing critical bugs, and providing production support to ensure somooth system performance. 



## Daily Task Performs and Role in the Project
On a daily basis, I work on application enhancements, bug fixes, and production support activities. My work involves analyzing requirements, implementing changes using Java and Spring Boot, exposing REST APIs and writing SQL queries. I also collaborate with frontend teams working on React. 

Primarily responsible for backend development, issue resolution, production support and application enhancements.

My responsibilities included implementing new features, fixing defects, supporting production incidents, and remediating security vulnerabilities identified through compliances scans. I also collaborated closely with frontend developers and operations teams to ensure smooth releases. 


## Explain the application you currently support or built end-to-end
I worked on an enterprise reporting and data integration application build using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, React deployed on AWS with Docker and managed via Github. 

The core functionality involves daily scheduled data ingestion from multiple upstream systems into our database. This data is processed and made available to users through tabular reports and downloadable PDFs. 

We also automated a previously manual process by integrating with external systems through REST APIs.

Overall, the application is business-critical and widely used by internal users for reporting and compliance purposes.


## How does frontend communicate with backend in your project
The frontend communicate with the backend using RESTful APIs over HTTP using AXIOS.

React makes API calls using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and the backend Spring Boot services expose endpoints that return JSON responses. 

Authentication and authorization are handled using secure tokens, and error responses are properly mapped so that meaningful messages are shown on the UI.


## What was the biggest technical challenge you faced

One major challenge was handling a half-yearly large data refresh activity when the primary resource responsible for the Linux jobs was unavailable due to a medical emergency. 

I proactively took ownership by studing exisiting knowledge articles, historical tickets, and cron job configuration, and independently executed the activity. 

During execution, we faced partial data failures due to special characters and data length constrainsts, which caused the process to stop after hiting an error threshold. 

I analyzed logs, identified the root cause, implemented a temporary workaround by correcting the input data, and applied a permanent fix by increasing database limits and error thresholds. 

The activity was completed successfully, and the application was stablized without business impact. This effort was recognized by management.



## How did you ensure code quality
I ensured code quality by following organizational coding standards, using meaningful naming conventions, writing reusable methods, and keeping the code modular. 

I also ensured proper error handling, performed code reviews and validated changes through testing before deployments, especially for production fixes.
