## Class 
A class is a blueprint or template that define properties(variables) and behaviors(methods).


# Java 8 Features
Java 8 mainly introduced support for functional-style programming in Java. The key features include lambda expressions and Stream API, which help write cleaner, more readable, and efficient code.

Java 8 also enhanced interfaces by adding default and static methods to maintain backward compatibility, so existing implementations don’t break when new methods are added.

Another important feature is the Optional class, which helps handle null values more safely by forcing explicit null checks.
Java 8 also introduced a new Date and Time API, and it brought performance improvements such as parallel streams and better internal optimizations. 

# Java 17 Features
Java 17 is a Long-Term Support version of Java that focuses on performance, security, and language improvements. It introduces features like sealed classes to control inheritance, pattern matching improvements to simplify code, and records to reduce boilerplate code for data objects.

Java 17 also includes strong encapsulation of internal APIs, better garbage collection performance, and several JVM optimizations that make applications more secure and efficient.

## Wrapper Class
Wrapper class create object of primitive data type as collection work on objects and not primitive data type.
