## Gateway
Gateway acts as a single entry point where routes, secures, and manages requests

## Pipeline Design
Pipeline desing is structuring a process into sequential steps where the output of one step becomes input to the next.

## Server
Server is a system that receives requests, processes them and send responses to clients.

## SQS
Simple Queue Service is a message queue that allows systems to communicate asynchronously and reliably.

## Load Balancing
Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availablity 

## Vertical Scalling
Increasing the CPU/RAM of one server to handle more load.

## Horizontal Scalling
Adding more servers to distribute the load.

## Sharding
Sharding is splitting a large database into smaller pieces(shards) stored on different servers.

## Partitioning
Partitioning divides data into smaller logical parts within the same database for better performance. 

## Caching
Caching stores frequently used data in fast memory to reduce database calls and improve speed.

## CDN
Content Delivery Network delivers content from servers closest to the user to reduce latency.
